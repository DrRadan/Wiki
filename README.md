# Wiki

**Wiki_death_scrapper** is a python notebook containing code for scraping Wikipedia for all deaths reported from  year 2006 to 2016. It keeps track of death year, month, and day. It also records the person’s name, age, and brief comments. The comments are also used to extract whether the diseased comes from an western, english-speaking country (WESCO), or was in a celebrity-prone-profession. Moreover the total length of the diseased’s Wikipedia entry total length (#word) is recorded as a metric of the person’s contributions/importance. The results are exported by year automatically as cvs in the same directory.
