# Wiki

**Wiki_death_scrapper** is code for scraping Wikipedia regarding information about all deaths reported from  year 2006 to 2016. The Python notebook runs all years automatically (takes long time) wile the plain .py waits for user input (acceptable years 2007-2016). It keeps track of death year, month, and day. It also records the person’s name, age, and brief comments. The comments are also used to extract whether the diseased comes from an western, english-speaking country (WESCO), or was in a celebrity-prone-profession (CPP). Moreover the total length of the diseased’s Wikipedia entry (number of words, ImportanceIndex) is recorded as a metric of the person’s contributions/importance. The results are exported as cvs by year automatically in the same directory.
